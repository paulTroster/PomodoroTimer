## What It Does

- **Personalized Timer Intervals:**  
  Configure focus sessions, short breaks, and long breaks to match your workflow.

- **Session Tracking with Auto-Stop:**  
  The timer tracks your completed focus sessions and automatically stops when you reach your preset session limit.

- **Streamlined Controls:**  
  The Start and Stop buttons are prominently placed at the top of the settings panel for quick access.

- **Fast Mode for Testing:**  
  For demo or testing purposes, enable Fast Mode to have time progress 60Ã— faster (1 real second equals 1 minute).

- **Sound Alerts:**  
  A designated OBS media source plays an alert sound during transitions between focus and break periods.

- **Seamless OBS Integration:**  
  The script updates a chosen text source in OBS with live timer data and session counts, ensuring your stream is always up-to-date.
